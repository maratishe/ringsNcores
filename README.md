This project is a research spin-off of https://github.com/maratishe/mcorememory, where the *mcorememory* project is the implementation while this one is resaerch-oriented analysis of its performance. 

This space will mostly be used for various models for parallelization of packet processing.  Packet traffic is unique and requires special models of which the shared memory design in https://github.com/maratishe/mcorememory is one example.
